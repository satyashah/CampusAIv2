Once the instructor has submitted the grades, students can view them in [Testudo](http://testudo.umd.edu) the next day. An NG (No Grade) on your transcript or NGR (No Grade Reported) on the Grades application in [Testudo](http://testudo.umd.edu) will display until your instructor submits your final grade. If your grade has not been reported for a course after GPAs have calculated for a term, you should contact the instructor to determine why a grade has not been submitted."]}
