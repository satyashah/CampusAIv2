Students who have not yet earned an associate's degree may be eligible to transfer courses completed at the University of Maryland back to the previously attended Maryland public community college to earn an associate's degree. The courses completed at the University of Maryland may count toward both the completion of the associate's and bachelor's degrees. To be eligible for reverse transfer, the student must have transferred from a Maryland public community college to the University of Maryland with at least 15 credit hours and meet the following criteria: Completed at least 15 credit hours prior to transferring to the University of Maryland. - Be in good academic standing at both the Maryland public community college and the University of Maryland with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher. - Have not previously been awarded either an associate's or bachelor's degree. - Each Maryland public community college has their own established procedures. Please contact the community college directly for more information. In general, the student should: Notify the Registrar's Office at the Maryland public community college where you previously attended and are interested in applying for the reverse transfer associate degree. - Request that your official transcript be sent from the University of Maryland to the community college in which you are applying for the reverse transfer associate degree. - The community college will determine if the student is eligible for reverse transfer and will contact the student with their decision. -"]}
