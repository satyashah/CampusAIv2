A course that is deemed not acceptable for transfer credit cannot satisfy a degree requirement. - A transfer course may not satisfy a general education requirement if it is not approved for general education during the evaluation process. - Official transcripts are submitted. Students are responsible for submitting all final official transcripts detailing their entire academic record prior to enrolling at UMD. Transfer courses will post to a student's UMD record only from official transcripts received from the institution at which the credit was earned.Admitted or currently enrolled students should send electronic transcripts to [registrar-help@umd.edu](mailto:%20registrar-help@umd.edu), and printed transcripts to: University of Maryland Office of the University Registrar 1113 Clarence M.

Students may refer to the [Transfer Course Database](https://app.transfercredit.umd.edu/)to see a library of transfer courses that have already gone through the evaluation process. Generally, college-level courses completed at regionally-accredited institutions will transfer to UMD, provided the course is similar in level, scope, content and expected learning outcomes to courses offered at UMD, and a grade of C- or higher is earned (grades of D- or higher are accepted for courses completed at Maryland public institutions). A course that is considered accepted for transfer to UMD will receive one of the following types of evaluations:direct equivalency to a UMD course (whether within or outside the major), - no direct equivalency, but satisfies general education requirement, or - no direct equivalency, but is accepted as a general elective. - Students work with an academic advisor to understand how transfer courses satisfy degree requirements: Students who have been admitted to UMD should contact their advising college for assistance. - Students who have not been admitted to UMD should contact the [Pre-Transfer Advising Program](http://www.transferadvising.umd.edu/)for assistance. - Transfer Credit Services does not provide advising services. - Questions regarding the posting of these courses should be directed to Records and Registration Services at [registrar-help@umd.edu](mailto:%20registrar-help@umd.edu).Course evaluation request is submitted. Students who would like to request an evaluation of a course for transfer to UMD will need to provide a detailed syllabus from the semester/term when the course was taken. The syllabus must be in digital format, either .pdf or .docx. Students should send the course syllabus via email. If sending multiple course syllabi, group the courses by subject or related course (i.e. send a separate email for mathematics, history, music, etc.). Each course in the request should include a course ID, full title of the course, and term the course was taken. Please format the evaluation request email as shown in the example below: To: [See [departmental evaluators list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2UvOX-gpuye0kB0nW14xPU99BOZsbBuYODxu-U-bVc/edit)]Subject: Transfer Course Eval Request - [insert institution name] Email Body: Hello, My name is [insert full name] and my UID is [insert 9-digit UID].

All degree-seeking undergraduate applicants for admission to UMD are required to submit an official credential evaluation for all international post-secondary transcripts from one of the two evaluators: [ECE (Educational Credential Evaluators)](http://www.ece.org/ECE/Individuals/Education-Reports)- The ECE third party evaluation provides a comprehensive review of the official transcript, which includes: credit and grade conversions, grade point calculation, and upper division course designations. Students should select the \"Course by Course\" report option for ECE.[Josef Silny & Associates Application Form](https://www.jsilny.org/pdf/universityofMaryland.pdf)- The JSA third party evaluation provides a comprehensive review of the official transcript, which includes: credit and grade conversions, grade point calculation, and upper division course designations for students with more than 1 year of post-secondary/university education completed. Students should select the \"Post-Secondary/University Course-by-Course + GPA\" option, and the \"Upper Division Course Identification\" if applicable. - Official transcripts are submitted to UMD. To ensure all completed transfer courses are posted to the UMD record, a final official transcript in the original-language and a literal (exact) certified English translation must be submitted to UMD after all coursework has been completed.
