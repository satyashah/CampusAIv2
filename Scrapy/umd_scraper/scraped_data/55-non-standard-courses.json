These courses are identified in the [Schedule of Classes](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/) with an explicit start and end date (see example below). Additionally, non-standard courses have different dates than standard semesters and terms for the Schedule Adjustment Period and Drop Period (also referred to as Drop with \"W\"). Students are notified with an alert message while registering for a non-standard course and are responsible for being aware of the non-standard course dates and deadlines found below."]}
